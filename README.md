   - Python syntax is clear and straightforward, which makes the code easy to read and write.
   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

2. **Interpreted Language:**
   - Python is an interpreted language, meaning that it is executed line-by-line, which makes debugging easier.
   ```python
   x = 5
   y = 10
   print(x + y)  # Output: 15
   ```

3. **Dynamic Typing:**
   - Variables in Python do not need explicit declaration to reserve memory space, and the type is determined at runtime.
   ```python
   a = 5       # a is an integer
   a = "Hello" # now a is a string
   ```

4. **Extensive Standard Library:**
   - Python has a vast standard library that supports many common programming tasks such as file I/O, system calls, and even Internet protocols.
   ```python
   import os
   print(os.getcwd())  # Output: Current working directory
   ```

5. **Object-Oriented:**
   - Python supports object-oriented programming (OOP) with classes and objects.
   ```python
   class Dog:
       def __init__(self, name):
           self.name = name

       def bark(self):
           print(f"{self.name} says woof!")

   my_dog = Dog("Buddy")
   my_dog.bark()  # Output: Buddy says woof!
   ```

6. **Cross-Platform:**
   - Python can run on various operating systems, such as Windows, macOS, and Linux, without requiring any changes to the code.

7. **Support for Multiple Paradigms:**
   - Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
   ```python
   # Functional programming example
   def add(x, y):
       return x + y

   result = add(5, 3)
   print(result)  # Output: 8
   ```

8. **Large Community and Ecosystem:**
   - Python has a large and active community, which contributes to a rich ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools.

### Use Cases Where Python is Particularly Effective

1. **Web Development:**
   - Python frameworks like Django and Flask are used to build robust web applications.
   ```python
   from flask import Flask
   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def home():
       return "Hello, Flask!"

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       app.run(debug=True)
   ```

2. **Data Analysis and Scientific Computing:**
   - Libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy are used extensively for data manipulation and scientific computing.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   data = {
       'Name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie'],
       'Age': [24, 27, 22]
   }

   df = pd.DataFrame(data)
   print(df)
   ```

3. **Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence:**
   - Python is the go-to language for machine learning and AI, with popular libraries like TensorFlow, Keras, and scikit-learn.
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   import numpy as np

   X = np.array([[1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [2, 3]])
   y = np.dot(X, np.array([1, 2])) + 3

   model = LinearRegression().fit(X, y)
   print(model.predict(np.array([[3, 5]])))  # Example prediction
   ```

4. **Automation and Scripting:**
   - Python is widely used for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.
   ```python
   import os

   for filename in os.listdir('.'):
       if filename.endswith('.txt'):
           print(f"Text file: {filename}")
   ```

5. **Game Development:**
   - Libraries like Pygame are used to develop 2D games.
   ```python
   import pygame

   pygame.init()
   screen = pygame.display.set_mode((640, 480))
   running = True

   while running:
       for event in pygame.event.get():
           if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
               running = False

   pygame.quit()
   ```

6. **Network Programming:**
   - Python provides libraries for network programming and building network applications.
   ```python
   import socket

   s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
   s.connect(("www.example.com", 80))
   s.sendall(b"GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: www.example.com\r\n\r\n")
   data = s.recv(1024)
   print(data)
   s.close()
   ```

Python’s versatility and ease of use make it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple scripts to complex web applications and machine learning models.

Qn (3). Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
'''
print('Hello, World!')

'''

   print() Function:

The print() function is a built-in Python function used to output text to the console.
In this example, print() is used to display the string "Hello, World!".
Strings:

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks. In Python, you can use either single (') or double (") quotation marks to define a string.
Here, "Hello, World!" is a string literal enclosed in double quotation marks.
Function Call:

In Python, you call a function by typing the function name followed by parentheses ().
The parentheses can contain arguments that you pass to the function. In this case, the string "Hello, World!" is passed as an argument to the print() function.





Qn (4). Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.


   
Basic Data Types in Python
Python has several built-in data types, which can be broadly categorized into the following groups:

Numeric Types:

int: Represents integers, which are whole numbers without a fractional part.
float: Represents floating-point numbers, which are numbers with a decimal point.
complex: Represents complex numbers, which have a real part and an imaginary part.
Sequence Types:

str: Represents strings, which are sequences of characters.
list: Represents ordered collections of items, which can be of different data types.
tuple: Represents ordered, immutable collections of items, which can be of different data types.
Mapping Type:

dict: Represents unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Set Types:

set: Represents unordered collections of unique items.
frozenset: Represents immutable sets.
Boolean Type:

bool: Represents Boolean values, which can be either True or False.
None Type:

NoneType: Represents the absence of a value or a null value. It has a single value, None.
Script Demonstrating Variables of Different Data Types
Here's a short Python script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types:

python
Copy code
# Numeric Types
int_var = 10                # Integer
float_var = 20.5
